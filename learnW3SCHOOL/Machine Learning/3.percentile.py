# What are Percentiles ? 

# use the NumPy percentile() method to find the percentiles : 

# import numpy as np 

# ages = [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]

# x = np.percentile(ages,75)

# print(x)

print("-----------------------------------")

# what is the age that 90% of the people are younger than ? 

# import numpy as np 

# ages = [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]

# x = np.percentile(ages,90)

# print(x)

print("-----------------------------------")
